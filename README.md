# Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Classification using CNN

This project applies **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify microscopic blood cell images for the detection of **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)** â€” a cancer of the blood and bone marrow that affects white blood cells. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment, and deep learning provides a powerful approach to assist hematologists by automating the identification of leukemic cells from normal cells.

The model is trained on blood smear image datasets, leveraging CNN architectures to automatically learn features such as cell morphology, nucleus structure, and cytoplasm patterns. By reducing reliance on manual inspection, this project demonstrates how AI can accelerate the diagnostic process and improve patient outcomes.

## Key Features
- End-to-end **CNN-based image classification pipeline**
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Training, validation, and testing with metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Potential deployment in **medical decision support systems**
